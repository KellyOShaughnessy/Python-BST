###*Overview:*
>BinaryTree.py contains a basic implementation of a binary search tree.
>An instance of a BinaryTree has a root node, and a size.
>Items of the tree are represented by nodes, which have a left child, right child, and a value.
>
>This tree also contains methods for printing postorder, inorder, and preorder traversals.

###Methods:
-->insert(val)

-->insert_list(val_list)

-->get_left(node)

-->get_right(node)

-->preorder_print(root)

-->inorder_print(root)

-->postorder_print(root)

###Testing:
Currently contains a main function with an example of how to create a binary search tree.
Therefore, it can be run like a python 2 script.
